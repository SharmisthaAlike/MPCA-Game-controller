# MPCA Game controller
 
 a custom IoT-based racing game controller using Raspberry Pi and Arduino, integrated with 
a Unity game via UDP communication. Utilized load cells, analog joystick, and piezoelectric sensors to simulate realistic driving 
inputs. Raspberry Pi acted as the central server, handling sensor data and serial communication with Arduino to deliver real-time 
controls to the game.
